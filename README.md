# Title of the Project:
SkinTone Harmony : Advanced Cosmetic Color Matching Application Using Image Classification Method Based on Skin Tone

# Executive Summary/Abstract:
Makeup is generally important as it can make people look more attractive and increase self-confidence especially for women. 
Nowadays, with the rise of makeup brands and media to determine makeup on the internet, users are still confused to choose what suits their skin. 
Because they don't know the details of what skin tone they have and don't know which makeup suits them. This makes us want to solve the problem by creating an Android application that recommends foundations that match the skin tone of each user. Our team chose this topic because we want to help people who are still confused about what makeup that matches the skin tone they have, especially foundation makeup.
